# temporal albums

## travel pipeline

- only import un-geotagged jpegs/raws/heif, not pngs; remove pngs from existing albums
- future: only import non-geotagged photos _with faces_ if they include one of the faces from geotagged photos; remove unknown-face from existing albums

## visit (face) pipeline

- establish face baseline
- cluster high numbers of atypical face appearances over 2-day windows

### required support: face DB

- face (re)recognition
- web UI for naming and merging

## holiday pipeline

- works on user request only
    - holiday name & date, birthday name & date
- start with date of holiday +/- 2 days; birthday +/- 1 day
- work outward from the actual date, merging face and travel clusters originating within the window

## superpipeline

- consolidate clusters based on overlapping dates, preferring "holiday" as the primary theme, then "trip", then "visit"
- create albums (eventually this is the only spot that'll do this)

# thematic albums

## B&W

simple algorithm

## Others

brute-force LLM approach with albums query, tracking which photos are/aren't in which albums. Ask LLM for photographic quality score, though, including quality and composition factors, and only keep 4/5 or 5/5 in thematic albums.
