# general

- refactor & restructure

# temporal albums

## travel pipeline

- test & fine tune
- album naming

## visit (face) pipeline

- establish face baseline
- cluster high numbers of atypical face appearances over 2-day windows
- integrate no-face photos within the time window

## holiday pipeline

- start with date of holiday/birthday/etc. +/- 3 days
- work outward from the actual date, merging face and travel clusters originating

## superpipeline

- consolidate clusters based on overlapping dates, preferring "holiday" as the primary theme, then "trip", then "visit"
- create albums (eventually this is the only spot that'll do this)

# thematic albums

## B&W

simple algorithm

## Others

brute-force LLM approach with albums query, tracking which photos are/aren't in which albums. Ask LLM for photographic quality score, though, including quality and composition factors, and only keep 4/5 or 5/5 in thematic albums.
